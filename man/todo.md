 - If a variable contains new lines, treat it as an array and process each line individually

 - Implement FOR command
   - Similar to the above, FOR will iterate over each line in a variable
   - Syntax: `FOR ITEM IN $ARRAY DO (TAB OPEN $ITEM)`
 - tab list, tabgroup list, etc, should accept asterisk wildcard rather then using `startsWith`
